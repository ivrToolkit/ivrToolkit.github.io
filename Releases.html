<ul>
    <li>
        Breaking change to IVoice interface. GetLine method signature is now: <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GetLine(int lineNumber, object data = null);<br />
        Where data can be a string representing the device name of the Dialogic line. For Example: ':P_pdk_na_an_io:V_dxxxB1C1'<br />
        This is only needed if your aren't able to define what you need in the voice.properties file. voice.deviceNamePattern.<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        New keyValue in voice.properties called 'voice.deviceNamePattern' which is defaulted to ':P_pdk_na_an_io:V_dxxxB{board}C{channel}'. This is accessed
        by the dialogic plugin using Voice.Current.DeviceNamePattern. Valid keywords are {line}, {board} and {channel}. Board and channel are calculated
        based on the line number. 4 lines per board.<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Replaced dx_open with gc_OpenEx. This is supposed to allow SIP use with the Dialogic PowerMedia HMP for Windows software. I'll be testing that
        next week.
    </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>
        Added void RecordToFile(string filename, int timeoutMillisconds) to ILine interface. Modified the dialogic and simulator
        plugin to use the new method. The previous RecordToFile method would record indefinitely if the caller hung up during the
        record.
    </li>
    <li>
        Fixed the GetLine method in Dialogic.cs so that it now properly caluclates the board and channel number for a line
        number greater than 4.
    </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>
        Add volume control methods
    </li>
    <li>
        Removed prompt terminator character 'T'. You can get the same result by using terminator 't' and
        specifying AllowBlank=false
    </li>
</ul>
<a href="https://github.com/ivrToolkit/ivrToolkit/archive/release-0.9.5.zip">release-0.9.5.zip</a><br />

<ul>
    <li>
        Fixed bug where dialing a number like '9,1112223333' would not dial the 9. This only happened when dial.customOutbound.enabled=true in voice.properties
    </li>
    <li>
        Fixed bug where line status didn't switch from 'AcceptingCalls' to 'Connected' after the WaitRings method answered a call.
    </li>
</ul>
<a href="https://github.com/ivrToolkit/ivrToolkit/archive/release-0.9.4.zip">release-0.9.4.zip</a><br />

<ul>
    <li>
        Change the licensing from GPL to LGPL.
    </li>
    <li>
        Modified prompt.attempts from 2 to 5 in voice.properties. However, I think this will be changed to prompt.noResponseAttempts instead since the intent was to stop endless looping of a prompt if the user hung up and the system did not detect the hangup.
    </li>
</ul>
