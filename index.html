    <h2>What is the IVR Toolkit?</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
            The ivrToolkit is a dotNet library for developers wanting to write telephony applications. The main project is ivrToolkit.core which calls
            plugins that implement the IVoice and ILine interfaces.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are currently two plugins written that use ivrToolkit.core. They are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                ivrToolkit.SimulatorPlugin
                <p>
                    Usees your windows sound card so that you can develop and test your application without having to use the phone or requiring a phone card.
                    It is intended to be used with the ivrToolkit.Virtual Phone project.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                ivrToolkit.DialogicPlugin
                <p>
                    For use with Dialogic Voice cards.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Provide an easy to use API
                <p>
                    Cuts down on your development time for new projects.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Provide an easy migration path for existing legacy projects.
                <p>
                    The ivrToolkit was originaly written to replace some legacy 3rd party telephony products that no longer exist. At the time, the options were very expensive so
                    I decided to write my own. The goal was to provide an easy migration path for anyone faced with the same situation.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Continued development of Core and Plugins
                <p>
                    The ivrToolkit.Core and it's plugins are just the beginning. They are an integral part of the ivrToolKit.Web project.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                VoiceXML and CCXML support (currently in the planning stages only)
                <p>
                    The ivrToolkit.Web project is a MVC4 web application is a full blown IVR service that will manage and run your voice scripts.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
