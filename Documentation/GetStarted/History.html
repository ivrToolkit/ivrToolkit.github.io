    </p>
    <p>
        Many many years ago, I wrote a an automated dialer program written in VB6 and using
        a library called VisualVoice. This communicated with Dialogic Analog boards.
        Typically Dialogic D/41H jct-ls, D/120 jct-ls  
    </p>
    <p>Either VisualVoice went out of business or they never created a C# version, I am just not sure.
        Wanting to move forward, I created the IvrToolkit project. The API is fairly similar to
        what VisualVoice did in order to keep conversions simple. We were still using analog voice boards from Dialogic.
    </p>
    <P>Eventually the company I worked for wanted to move to SIP so a coworker of mine
        wrote the first version of the ivrToolkit.Dialogic.Sip in C++. We used that plugin for years.
        However, that C++ version was very hard to maintain so I converted it to C# which exists today.
        It was always based on the Dialogic HMP driver. The HMP driver uses a virtual board. I think
        they did this so that the HMP API was somewhat similar to the analog API that they had.
        It was either that or it allowed them to charge $$$ for the number of lines. You can only
        have one outbound call per line.
    </P>
    <a>SipSorcery. Recently, I took a look at Sipsorcery and figured I would give that a try.
        I am very pleased with what I am seeing so far and if it pans out, I think it will, I will
        start using it instead of the Dialogic SIP plugin. All I have to do is swap the Dialogic plugin
        for the SipSorcery plugin and it is done!
